This is an addon for those that hate involuntary fun on their expense. It automatically removes known transform effects like masks, turkey transforms and so on by removing its associated aura.

Note that auras can only be removed in this manner outside of combat. If you are transformed while engaged in combat, the aura will be removed once combat ends.

***\*If you're transformed by an aura not currently on the list, please report the name of the aura that transformed you using the issues link above, and I'll add it in the next update!***
