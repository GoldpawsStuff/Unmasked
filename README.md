This is an addon for those that hate fun. 

It gives you a clickable red X when you are under the effect of a known Hallow's Eve or Blingtron dance transform. Clicking the X removes the transform and makes you beautiful again. 
Note that since this addon uses secure macro buttons to be able to remove auras, it can only parse and update the button outside of combat. This means if somebody wands you during combat, the button will not appear until combat ends. This is a game limitation.
