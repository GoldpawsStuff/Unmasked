This is an addon for those that hate fun.

It gives you a clickable red X when you are under the effect of a known Hallow's Eve or Blingtron dance transform. Clicking the X removes the transform and makes you beautiful again.

You can move the button by holding down Ctrl and dragging it. And you can reset its position by holding down Shift and clicking it. Note that this can only be done when the button is actually visible, and I don't intend to change this behavior.

***\*If you're transformed by an aura not currently on the list, please report the name of the aura that transformed you using the issues link above, and I'll add it in the next update!***

***\*\*Also note that since this addon uses secure macro buttons to be able to remove auras, it can only parse and update the button outside of combat. This means if somebody wands you during combat, the button will not appear until combat ends. This is a game limitation.***
